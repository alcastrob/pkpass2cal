# pkpass2cal

This .NET windows application is a tiny utility for automating my workflow when I buy pkpass tickets in my desktop. Basically it opens the file and add it to my favorite cloud service for automatic sync with my mobile and also creates an appoiment in my calendar with all the details of the ticket.

## Installation

No special steps are needed. Just compile the project and once you have the .exe you can customize the .config file for adding you custom calendar, cloud and pkpass issuers with your own preferences.
